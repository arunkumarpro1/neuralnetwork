# neuralnetwork

Implementation of a simple neural network (NN) having two hidden layers, besides the input and output layers. Input data is first pre-processed and then the processed data will run through your neural net. 

The code is tested on the following three datasets using all three activation functions:
1. Car Evaluation Dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Car+Evaluation
2. Iris Dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris
3. Adult Census Income Dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income
